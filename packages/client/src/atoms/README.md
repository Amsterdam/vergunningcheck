### Atoms

Atoms are the smallest, most basic building blocks of UI design. Typical examples of atoms we have in this project are:
- Buttons
- Labels
- Links
- Lists
- Text renderers (Alert, ContactSentence, Disclaimer, TextToEdit)

Usually, atoms are very abstract in their essence and limited to a single functionality that can be included in many pages. They are not very useful by themselves. 

When adding new atoms, try to keep them as small and basic as possible. Being the smallest building block of atomic design, atoms cannot include other components.
